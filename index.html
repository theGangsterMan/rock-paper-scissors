            Pseudo code:
            First create system to promt user to input choice of rock, paper, or scissors which must be a typed string of one of those three choices and must be caseinsensitive.
            Make case insensitive by translating all user inputed strings to be lowercase in code to be compared to computer generated response.
            Create algorithem to randomly pick between 3 values( 1, 2, and 3) that correspond to it choosing randomly between r,p,s.
            Convert value generated( 1, 2, and 3) to strings ( rock, paper, and scissors) so to be compared equally.
            create algorithm to compare values to eachother and respond accordingly depending on if the user wins, loses, or draws.
